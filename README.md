<strong>Project Title: SQL Queries for Movies Database</strong>

<strong>Project Overview:</strong>

In this project, I worked with a SQLite database named movies.db, which contained data about movies, their ratings, and the people involved in them. The database included tables for movies, people, ratings, stars, and directors. My task was to write SQL queries to extract specific information from this database to answer various questions about movies, ratings, and people.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SQLite:</strong> I used SQLite to interact with the movies.db database. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless database engine that allowed me to execute SQL queries on the database.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL:</strong> I wrote SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the database.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> I extracted information about movies released in specific years, such as 2008 and 2012, and sorted data based on release dates and ratings.</li>
  <li><strong>Rating Analysis:</strong> I determined the number of movies with perfect IMDb ratings and calculated the average rating of movies released in a particular year.</li>
  <li><strong>Movie Titles and Details:</strong> I listed movie titles and their release years for specific franchises, like Harry Potter, and sorted them chronologically.</li>
  <li><strong>People Information:</strong> I identified the birth year of specific individuals, such as Emma Stone, and listed the names of people who starred in particular movies, like Toy Story.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborations:</strong> I found movies featuring collaborations between specific actors, like Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.</li>
  <li><strong>Exclusive Lists:</strong> I created exclusive lists of people who starred in movies with Kevin Bacon, ensuring Kevin Bacon himself was excluded from the results.</li>
</ul>
